1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,180
From this distant vantage point the earth might not seem of any particular interest

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,600
But for us it's different

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,860
Consider again that dut

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,720
That's here

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,120
That's home

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,500
That's us

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:21,960
On it

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,580
Everyone you love

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,300
Everyone you know

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,280
Everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives

11
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,860
The aggregate of our joy and suffering

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,020
Thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,440
Every hunter and forager

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,300
Every heroe and coward every creator and destroyer of civilization every king and peasant

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,320
Every young couple in love every mother and father hopeful child

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,120
Inventor and explorer every teacher of morals everycorrupt politician every

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,820
Superstar every

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,780
Supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,220
Lived there on a mote of dust

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,140
Suspended in a sunbeam

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,980
The earth is a very small stage in a vast

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,980
Cosmic arena

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,880
Think of the rivers of blood builled by all those generals and emperors

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,920
So that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,620
Of affraction of a dott

26
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:54,940
Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner how frequent their misunderstandings how eager they are to kill one another how fervent their hatreds our

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,040
Posturings

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,300
Our imagined

29
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:07,320
Self-importance the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe are challenged by this point of pale light

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,260
Our planet

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,620
Is a lonely speck in the great

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,740
Enveloping cosmic dark

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,560
In our

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,900
Obscurity

35
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,180
In all this vastness

36
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:30,700
There is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves the earth is the only world known so far to harbour life

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,300
There is nowhere else at least in the near future to which our species could migrate

38
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,660
Is it

39
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:38,840
Yes

40
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,020
Settle not yet

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:50,540
Like it or not for the moment the earth is where we make our stand it has been said that astronomy is a humbling and

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,340
Character-building experience there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,440
Than this distant image of our tiny world

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:13,760
To me it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dut the only home we've ever known
